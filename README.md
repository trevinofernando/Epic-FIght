# Epic-FIght

For a Full explanation of what this program should do, please read "Epic_Fight_ps.pdf"

Programing Language: 
-
Java.

Description: 
-
Given a set of moves for 2 fighters, the wining fighter, and the time of the battle in seconds, this program will count as fast as possible all of the possible outcomes the fight could have gone considering the inputs (modâ€™ed by 10,000 to keep the number small). In order to not blow the stack with the massive amount of states that a recursive approach would make and memory consumed by saving the states. This program uses a dynamic programming approach by making a 2D arrays with all possible states at each second in the fight and generating the next states in a second 2D array. 

Benefit: 
-
Practice Dynamic programing skills and fun.
